A) Pre-Requisites

1) Android device or emulator running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher.
2) Android Studio 4.2 or higher.
3) Internet connectivity for user authentication.

B) Description: 

The main purpose of this project is to create a timesheet management application that helps users efficiently track and manage their working hours.
The app aims to provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to log and categorize their timesheet entries.
One of the key challenges individuals face is accurately recording their working hours and organizing them into different categories.
To address this, the app includes features such as a login system, ensuring secure access to personalized accounts and protecting user data.
A notable feature of the app is the ability to create projects, which allows users to organize their timesheet entries based on different projects or tasks. 
This categorization feature offers a clear overview of the time spent on specific activities, aiding in better project management.
Furthermore, the app provides options to add additional information to each timesheet entry. Users can include descriptions to document the nature of their work and even attach photographs if needed.
To help users stay on track with their work goals, the app allows them to set minimum and maximum daily working hour targets. 
This feature encourages productivity and effective time management by giving users a clear target to aim for each day.
The app also enables users to view and filter their timesheet entries based on a chosen period. 
This functionality makes it easy to track and analyze work history, evaluate productivity, monitor progress, and make informed decisions.
Lastly, users can view the total number of hours spent on each category during a specified period. 
This feature provides valuable insights into time allocation, helping users identify areas where they may be spending too much or too little time.
Overall, the goal of this project is to offer a robust and user-friendly timesheet management solution. 
By simplifying the process of tracking and categorizing working hours, the app empowers users to optimize their productivity and achieve their professional goals.
